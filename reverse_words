/* Can we use the same concept but apply it to words instead of characters?

Probably. We'll have to figure out a couple things:

How do we figure out where words begin and end?
Once we know the start and end indices of two words, how do we swap those two words?
We could attack either of those first, but I'm already seeing a potential problem in terms of runtime. Can you guess what it is?

What happens when you swap two words that aren't the same length?
